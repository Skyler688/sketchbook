### Sketchbook

## TODO

- (DONE) Add sub menu toggle and resizing.
- (DONE) Start experementing with the canvas drawing lines and shapes/ free draw.
- Save the drawing data object to the browser each time a line is created.
- On refresh of the canvas component render and draw the drawing using the saved data.
- Create a css color pallet that the hole app uses, this will help unify the colors across components and allow for the addition of multiple themes.
- Add the logout function and a user/settings submenu
- Add the translate and scale functions to allow for the move/zoom feature.
